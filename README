Installing the plugin in Primo
------------------------------
- Make sure you can access the Primo WebServices
  Configure the correct IP ranges in our case our Campus in the 'WS and XS IP' mapping table 

- Create a directory under fe_web and copy the show_pnx.js file to this directory

  $ fe_web
  $ mkdir ADDONS
  $ cd ADDONS
  $ cp [PATH TO FILE]/show_pnx.js ./

Replace [PATH TO FILE] with the actual path of the file :)

- Go to your 'Views Wizard' and add a custom tile to the end of your customized layout set. You have to do this for the 3 pages.
  For details on how to do this look in the Primo manuals or contact me if you get stuck. 
  Create a new file show_pnx.jsp in the ADDONS directory and add this line

     <script type="text/javascript" src="../ADDONS/show_pnx.js"></script>

  set the path to this file as your custom tile path this should be ../ADDONS/show_pnx.jsp

- Deploy your view and you should see a 'Show PNX' link under the material type icon. 



Remarks
-------
- Doesn't work for Primo Central records. PC is a distributed search engine and probably has a different configuration for every customer.
- Not tested on Internet Explorer.
- When you restrict the access to the WebServices through 'WS and XS IP' mapping table be aware that the link will not work in certain situations.
- Will not show dedup pnx records
